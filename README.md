# mblasm
Consensus (assembly) generator from mgblast (modified megablast) pairwise alignments.

This was part of the old TGI (TIGR Gene Indexes) pipeline for generating a "tentative consensus" assembly of ESTs from pairwise alignments. The alignments were generated by a modified version of NCBI's megablast, which also provided gap information in a tab delimited output. The primitive OLC assembly procedure included in this program is based on generating an incremental MSA from the pairwise alignments, propagating gaps according to a simple "once a gap, always a gap" approach.

The mblaor program also included here performs an even simpler "assembly on reference" procedure, based solely on alignments of reads to larger "reference" sequences (so the costly all-vs-all pairwise searches can be reduced to just performing reads-vs-references alignments).
